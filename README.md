# PVP Trainer

This is a mod that can be used to train yourself in PVP. This is compatible with Carpet PVP, so you can use Theobald's PVP Practice Map.

## Why

When I changed my keybinds, it was tough for me to get used to those keybinds. I created this mod at that time to help me get used to those. Now I changed my keybinds again, and I had to start from scratch. Therefore, I decided to put more effort into creating a mod that could be useful for others as well.

## Features

- Shows the last pressed key on screen
- Show weather Is Sprinting.
- Shows hotbar keybind overlay (1–9)
- Client-side

## Upcoming Features (Hopefully, no promises ;)

- A way to visualize attribute swapping
- Show type of hit (Sprint, Sweep, Crit, Smash, Jab, Charge etc)

## Required Mods

- Cloth Config
- Mod Menu (Optional but recommended)

## Configuration

Following settings can be configured:

- Toggle Is Sprinting display.
- Toggle Last Pressed Key display.
- Customize text color, background color, and opacity
- Enable or disable mouse button detection
