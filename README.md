# PVP Trainer

This is a mod that can be used to train yourself in PVP. This is compatible with Carpet PVP, so you can use Theobald's PVP Practice Map.

## Why

When I changed my keybinds, it was tough for me to get used to those keybinds. I created this mod at that time to help me get used to those. Now I changed my keybinds again, and I had to start from scratch. Therefore, I decided to put more effort into creating a mod that could be useful for others as well.

## Dependencies

- Cloth Config
- Mod Menu (Optional but recommended)
